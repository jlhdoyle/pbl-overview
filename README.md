# pbl-overview

This is for storing a brief overview of [project-based learning](http://edglossary.org/project-based-learning/) I prepared for the teachers at my daughter's elementary school, without knowing how much exposure they had previously had to PBL (or time to read about PBL, for that matter).

Part of the philosophy of PBL is to allow time in the project for critique from the teacher and peers and the ability to revise one's work based on that feedback. Given that, it seemed appropriate to store this project in GitHub, so that it can be revised and improved over time.
